In this assignment you are tasked with writing a node that subscribes to a topic and publishes to another. Your code will subscribe to a topic called 'two_ints', on which a custom message containing two integers can be broadcast. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the message format of this topic (have a look at the TwoInts.msg in the msg directory). Those two integers are to be added and the result published to topic 'sum' as an Int16.
